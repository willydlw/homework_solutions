Assignment 3

-------------------------------
Program Specification
-------------------------------

Assets:
- Entities in the game will be rendered using various Textures and Animations
  which we will be calling Assets (along with Fonts)
- Assets are loaded once at the beginning of the program and stored in the 
  Assets class, which is stored by the GameEngine class. (or make the Assets class
  a singleton class as was provided to students)
- All Assets are defined in assets.txt, with the syntax defined below 

Note:
- All entity positions denote the center of their respective rectangular sprite.
  It also denotes the center of the bounding box, if it has one.
  This is set via sprite.setOrigin() in the Animation class constructor 

Player:
- The player Entity in the game is represented by Megaman, which has several
  different Animations: Stand, Run, and Air. You must determine which state 
  the player is currently in and assign the correct Animation.
- The player moves with the following controls:
    Left: A key
    Right: D key 
    Jump: W key 
    Shoot: space key 
- The player can move left, move right, or shoot at any time during the game.
  This means the player can move left/right while in the air.
- The player can only jump if it is currently standing on a tile.
- If the jump key is held, the player should not continuously jump, but 
  instead it should only jump one per button press. If the player lets go 
  of the jump button mid-jump, it should start falling back down immediately.
- If the player moves left/right, the player's sprite will face in that 
  direction until the other direction has been processed.
- Bullets shot by the player travel in the direction the player is facing.
- The player collides with 'Tile' entities in the level (see level syntax) and 
  cannot move through them. The player lands on a Tile entity and stands in place 
  if it falls on it from above.
- The player does not collide with 'Dec' (decoration) entities in the level 
- If the player falls below the bottom of the screen, they respawn at the start 
- The player should have a Gravity component which constantly accelerates it
  downward on the screen until it collides with a tile. 
- The player has maximum speed specified in the Level file (see below) which 
  it should not exceed in either x or y direction 
- The player will be give a CBoundingBox of a size specified in the level file 
- The player's sprite and bounding box are centered on the player's position.

Animations:
- See below for Animation asset specification 
- Animations are implemented by storing multiple frames inside a texture 
- The Animation class handles frame advancement based on animation speed 
- You need to implement Animation::update() to properly progress animations 
- You need to implement Animation:hasEnded() which returns to true if an 
  animation has finished its last frame, false otherwise 
- Animations can be repeating (loop forever) or non-repeating (play only once)
- Any entity with a non-repeating animation should be destroyed once its 
  Animation's hasEnded() return true (finished one cycle)

Decoration Entities:
- Decoration entities ('Dec' in a level file) are simply drawn to the screen 
  and do not interact with any other entities in the game in any way 
- Decorations can be giveing any Animation in the game, but intuitively they 
  should be reserved for things like clouds, bushed, etc 

Tiles:
- Tiles are Entities that define the level geometry and interact with players 
- Tiles can be given any Animation that is defined in the assets file 
- Tile will be given a CBoundingBox equal to the size of the animation 
  tile->get<CAnimation>().getSize() 
- The current animation displayed for a tile can be retrieved with 
    tile->get<CAnimation>().animation.getName() 
- Tiles have different behavior depending on which Animation they are given 

Brick Tiles:
- Brick Tiles are give the 'Brick' Animation 
- When a brick tile collides with a bullet, or is hit by a player from below:
  - Its animation should change to 'Explosion' (non-repeat)
  - Non-repeating animation entities are destroued when hasEnded() is true 
  - Its CBoundingBox component should be removed

Question Tiles:
- Question tiles are tive the 'Question' Animation when created 
- When a Question tile is high by a player from below, 2 things happen:
    - Its Animation changes to the darker 'Question2' animation 
    - A temporary lifespan entity with the 'Coin' animation should appear 
      for 30 frames, 64 pixels above the location of the Question entity

GUI:
- You must construct a GUI using ImGui which has the following functionality:
- The GUI must display options to turn off each system independently 
- For each entity in the game, the GUI must list the ID, tag, and position 
  of that entity. You must display a list of all entities, as well as 
  lists of entities by their tag. You must also have some way of destroying 
  a given entity by interacting with the UI element associated with it. 
  (this is essentially the same as assignment 2, to help in debugging the game)

Rendering:
- Entity rendering has been implemented for you, no need to change that system 
- Entities are rendered in the order that they are stored in the EntityManager,
  with later entities being drawn on top of previous ones.

Bonus:
- Any special effects which do not alter game play can added for up to 
  5% bonus marks on the assignment. Note that assignments cannot go above 
  100% total marks, but the 5% bonus can overwrite any marks lost in other 
  areas of the assignment.
- You may develop a 'special weapon' that has special effects which can 
  also contribute another 5% bonus marks available on the assignment.


Misc:
- The 'P' key should pause the game.
- Pressing the 'T' key toggles drawing textures 
- Pressing the 'C' key toggles drawing bounding boxes of entities 
- Pressing the 'G' key toggles drawing of the grid 
  This should be helpful for debugging.
- The 'ESC' key should go back to the Main Menu, or quit if on the Main Menu 


-------------------------------
Level Creation 
-------------------------------

For this assignment you are also requireed to create your own level. This level 
should include some interesting gameplay. Include this level in the zip files as
level.txt.

-------------------------------
Config Files 
-------------------------------

There will be two configuration files in this assignment. The Assets config 
file and the Level configuration file.


---------------------------------
Assets File Specification
---------------------------------

There will be three different line types in the Assets file, each of which 
correspond to a different type of Asset. They are as follows:

Texture Asset Specification:
Texture N P 
    Texture Name     N   std::string (it will have no spaces)
    Texture FilePath P  std::string (it will have no spaces)

Animation Asset Specification:
Animation N T F S 
    Animation Name  N   std::string(it will have no spaces)
    Texture Name    T   std::string (refers to an existing texture)
    Frame Count     F   int (number of frames in the animation)
    Anim Speed      S   int (number of game frames between anim frames)

Font Asset Specification:
Font    N   P 

    Font Name       N   std::string  (it will have no spaces)
    Font Path       P   std::string  (it will have no spaces)


-----------------------------------
Level Specification File 
-----------------------------------

Game levels will be specified b a Level file, which will contain a list of 
entity specifications, one per line. It will also contain a single line which 
specifies properties of the player in that level. In this way, you can define 
an entire level in the data file, rather than in programming code. The syntax 
of the lines of the level are as follows:

IMPORTANT NOTE:

    All(GX, GY) positions given in the level specifications file are given in 
    'grid' coordinates. The 'grid' cells are of size 64 by 64 pixels, and the 
    entity shoudl be positioned such that the bottom left corner of its texture 
    is aligned with the bottom left corner of the given grid coordinate. The 
    grid starts at (0,0) in the bottom-left of the screen, and can be seen by 
    pressing the 'G' key while the game is running.

    Example: Some entities occupy multple grid cells. Bush 
    1) Calculate grid cell bottom
    Be sure to account for the  half width half height

    2) Add AnimationSize/2 

Tile Entity Specification:

    Animation Name  N   std::string (Animation asset name for this tile)
    X Position      X   float

    Bullet Animation    B       std::string (Animation asset to use for bullets)


------------------------------
Assignemnt Hints 
------------------------------

- Rendering system has already been set up for you, to help you debug:
  You can press the T key to toggle drawing textures 
  You can press the C key to toggle drawing bounding boxes 
  You can press the G key to toggle drawing the grid 

- You can implement Animation::update() and Animation::hasEnded() at any time,
  it will not affect the gameplay mechanics whatsoever, just animation 

- Implement Scene_Play::loadLevel()
  Since rendering is already completed, once you correctly read in the different 
  types of entities, add them to the EntityManager and they should 
  automatically be drawn to the screen. Add the correct bounding boxes to Tile 
  entities, and no bounding boxes to the Dec entities. Remember, you can toggle 
  debug viewing of bouding boxes with the T and C keys
  
  As part of this step, implement the Scene_Play::gridToMidPixel() 
  function, which takes in as parameters a grid x,y position and an Entity,
  and returns the Vec2 position of the CENTER of that entity. You must use 
  the Animation size of the Entity to determine where its center point should be.
  Keep in mind taht this meand your Entity must have its CAnimation component added
  first, so that it can be used to calculate the midpoint in this function.


- Implement Scene_Play::spawnPlayer()
    Read the configuration from the level file and spawn the player 
    This is where the player should respawn when they die.

- Implement some basic WASD u/l/d/r movement for the player entity sot that you can
  use this to help test collisions in the future. Remember that you must registerAction 
  to register a new action for the scene. See the actions already registered for you, and 
  the sDoAction() function for syntax on how to perform actions.

  Test this before adding gravity and jumping.

- Implement Scene_Play::spawnBullet()
  Bullet should shoot when Space is pressed in same direction player facing
  Holding down the space button should not continuously fire bullets. A 
  new bullet can only be fired after the space key has been released. Use 
  the entity's CInput.canShoot variable to implement this.

- Implement Physics::GetOverlap()
  This function should return the overlap dimensions between the bounding boxes 
  of two entities. This is the same as the purple rectangle in notes.
  GetPreviousOverlap should be a copy/paste of this solution except using the 
  previous positions instead of the current positions of the entity. 
  If either input entity has no bouding box, then return Vec2(0,0)

- Implement collsion checking wiht bullets / brick tiles such that the brick 
  is destroyed when a bullet collides with it. Remember, a collision occurs 
  when the overlap is non-zero in both the x and y components. Bullets should 
  always be destroyed whtn the collide with any non-decorative tile. 

- Implement collision resolution such that when the player collides with a 
  non-decorative tile from below, its y-velocity should be set to zero so 
  that it falls back downward and doesn't 'hover' below the tile.

- Implement a way of detecting which side the player collided with the tile 

- Change the controls such that they are the proper left/right/jump style.
  Note: All movement logic should be in the movement system. The sDoAction
  system is ONLY used to set the proper CInput variables. If you modify the 
  player's speed or position anywhere inside the sDoAction system, you will 
  lose marks as this potentially unsafe / produces unwanted effects 

- Implement gravity such that the player falls toward the bottom of the 
  screen and lands on tiles when it collides with a tile from above. Note
  that when the player lands on the tile from above, you should set its vertical
  speed to zero so that gravity does not continue to accelerate the player downward.
